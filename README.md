_**What the current code does**_

This program is a simple library manager for your computer. It uses pop-up windows to help you manage your books. Here’s what you can do:
- Set up the library: The program automatically creates a database file called Library_Database.db on your computer the first time you run it. It’s like setting up a new card catalog.
- Add a book: A simple form pops up asking you for book details like the author, title, and page count. It makes sure everything is filled out correctly before adding the book to your collection.
- View your books: The program can fetch your entire book collection from the database and show it to you in a neat, easy-to-read, scrollable list.
- Use the main menu: A menu with clear buttons lets you choose what you want to do: "Add Book," "Check Books," or "Exit." 



_**How the code improves your experience**_

The code is designed to be user-friendly, clear, and reliable.
- It talks to you simply: The easygui pop-up windows replace complicated command-line text. The program holds your hand and guides you through each step with simple questions and button clicks.
- It lets you know what's happening: You'll always get clear messages. For instance, a pop-up tells you "Book added successfully!" so you know your action worked. You'll also know if a new database was created or if something went wrong.
- It handles your mistakes: If you forget to enter a title or accidentally type text where a number should be, the program won’t crash. It will show you a polite error message and ask you to fix it. This keeps things running smoothly.
- It saves your work: Your book collection is stored in a permanent database file. This means you can close the program and all your books will be there the next time you open it.
- It makes your books look good: When you view your books, they are neatly lined up in columns, making the list easy to read and understand, no matter how long the titles or author names are. 



_**Signs of a top-notch program**_

This code also has some features that developers appreciate, showing that it’s well-written and reliable.
- It's organized: The code is split into logical chunks (functions) for setting up the database, adding books, and showing books. This makes the code easy to understand, fix, and improve.
- It’s secure: The way the code adds new book data to the database prevents common security problems. It keeps your database safe from any clever tricks.
- It works everywhere: Since it uses standard Python libraries, this program should run on any computer, whether it's running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- It's well-documented: The comments and explanations inside the code clearly describe what each part does. This is a big help if someone else ever needs to work on or update the program.
